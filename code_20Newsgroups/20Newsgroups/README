Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the codes used to obtain the experimental results on 20Newsgroups dataset in [2]. 

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. If you have downloaded the dataset from http://vc.sce.ntu.edu.sg/transfer_learning_domain_adaptation/DAM-TNNLS2012/data_20Newsgroups.zip and extract it to the data folder, please do it first.  

2. KMM algorithm need the Mosek software, please modify the setpath.m file to added the Mosek toolbox to the environment.

3. The code is tested 64-bit Matlab installed on 64-bit Windows, you may need recompile the mex files in the utils folder when run on other environment.

File Descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. run_xxx.m, main_xxx.m, and show_result_all_xxx.m are the codes for algorithm xxx (e.g. fast_dam). The first two are used to obtain the results while the last one is used to print out existing results.
   
How to Run?
---------------------------------------------------------------
If the data set are prepared stored, you can execute 
   >>run_exp_comp_vs_rec
to obtain the experimental results in the setting of Comp vs Rec. 

Note that the order to run different algorithms matters, as some algorithm (e.g., FastDAM) may depend on the decision from other algorithms (e.g., SVM_S). So, you may follow the order in the run_exp_xxx.m to avoid such issues.

Also, we currently also provided the mex file for UniverDAM, which is compiled under 64-bit Matlab installed  on 64-bit Windows.
