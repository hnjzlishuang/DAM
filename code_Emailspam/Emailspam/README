Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the codes used to obtain the experimental results on Email spam dataset in [2]. 

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. If you have downloaded the dataset from http://vc.sce.ntu.edu.sg/transfer_learning_domain_adaptation/DAM-TNNLS2012/data_emailspam.zip and extract it to the data folder, please do it first.  

2. KMM algorithm need the Mosek software, please modify the setpath.m file to added the Mosek toolbox to the environment.

3. The code is tested 64-bit Matlab installed 64-bit Windows, you may need recompile the mex files in the utils folder when run on other environment.

File Descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. run_xxx.m, main_xxx.m, and show_result_all_xxx.m are the codes for algorithm xxx (e.g. fast_dam). The first two are used to obtain the results while the last one is used to print out existing results.
   
How to Run?
---------------------------------------------------------------
If the data set are prepared stored, you can execute 
   >>run_exp
to obtain the experimental results.
